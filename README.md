# probot-tax-bot
This bot calculates ProBot transaction taxes efficiently, as well as supports a specific channel where it calculates tax without the command.

The default command is "^tax {number}", but feel free to change it if you wish.
You can specify a tax channel where you only throw a number like "2000" and it calculates the taxes.
The bot also supports {num}K for 1000, {num}M for 1000000, {num}B for 1000000000.
